### Summary of the stage

A group of 8 students will behave like a set of teams:
 
1. build teams with 2-3 students
1. perform in three one-week sprints
1. select features to be developed during sprints
1. design and build voice activation algorithms for a small vehicle

### Background on the Autonomous Vehicle (1/3)

We want to add voice activation to a small vehicle that:

1. carries a small payload (<5Kg)
1. drives autonomously
1. follows directions given by voice

### Background on the Autonomous Vehicle (2/3)

The product idea builds on existing offerings from https://www.makeblock.com/.

Students will carefully examine the model and invent the new feature
with the important constrain that it should be possible to build it
during the stage. Bluewind offers two pieces of the selected platform
as a development base.

### Background on the Autonomous Vehicle (3/3)

The important feature to be identified and developed involves hearing voice
and selecting operations based on the words (voice command) and direction
of sound (voice directions).

One important software and experience starting point is a stage
work developed during 2018 by a group of students and known as
Project Vivaldi.

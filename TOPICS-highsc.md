### Social Distancing Control

Covid19 pandemic left the world with a need for reinventing ways we gather together in public and private spaces.
Several different products and technologies have been developed for Social Distancing Control.

1. learn how current Social Distancing control products work
2. invent a new technology or simple deployment
3. demonstrate an outcome in three weeks
4. prepare a paper during additional two weeks (after summer)

The product idea is:

> how to count people in a room, and check that mutual distance is not higher than what's safe

### Voice activated vehicle: path to Machine Learning

0. a group of 8 students divided in two or three teams
1. learn how to work in sprints (one sprint = one week round)
2. demonstrate an outcome in three weeks
3. prepare a paper during additional two weeks (after summer)

The product idea is:

>a small autonomous vehicle that carries things, activated by voice commands

### Design Sprint and autonomous vehicle

Design Sprint is a design innovation process that enables
preparing a prototype of a product or feature in exactly 5 days.
A group of 15 students will behave like a team:

1. will perform a Design Sprint
2. out of its results will develop the real product

The product idea is: small autonomous vehicle that carries things
following a path described by drawing lines with coloured pencils.

### Experiments on Byzantine Fault Tolerance

At the basis of Blockchain and Bitcoin is something called
Byzantine Fault Tolerant Replication Algorithm.
Studying such algorithms dates back to well
before blockchain and bitcoin, being an area
if interesting technologies by themselves.

This task is perfect for a group of between 4 to 8 students willing
to work at school with limited interaction with Bluewind and a teacher.

### Experiments on Blockchain

Blockchainâ€™s distribute ledger was born as a new disruptive way for
exchaning payments and currencies.
From another point of view the technology behind blockchain has
much broader usecases: it provides device identity, secure data transfer
and immutable data storage during online transactions and communications.

### Automation with Python scripting

Create a framework of simple automation tasks using Python on a
Raspberry 3 module, using MQTT as a messaging protocol. Tasks to be
automated may include: detecting mobile phones presence
(based on Bluetooth), relevant network activities, Internet speed
detect, heating system state, etc.
